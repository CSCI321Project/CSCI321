SYSTEM OVERVIEW
This feature is expected to hold the bulk of the appeal of this product. One of the unique
aspects of this section is that it allows for the user to “control” the parts of a car, like
switching on the headlights, or activating the windshield wipers. Some form of
conformation would accompany this action on the virtual instrument cluster to indicate the
action completed successfully.
In addition to that, the user would be able to learn more via the simulation of how
information or substances move about in the car. For example, a fuel system could be
simulated to show how does the fuel move from the tank to the engine. The simulation also
allows the user to see the various differences between different implementations of a car,
like the electric propulsion system in an electric vehicle against a fuel-powered engine in a
regular car. This is expected to teach users with a bit more detail on how the car works. It
is expected that the simulations in this feature would be multithreaded.

SYSTEM STRUCTURE
The user will be able to virtually control the car in this section. In this section, the
controllable items like lights, indicators, wipers and climate control system would run in
their own threads, to allow them to run independently, while at the same time, being able
to send messages to other parts of the car, like turning on the lights would send a
message to the instrument cluster thread to light up the headlight on indicator. Besides
being able to control the car, the user will be able to view the simulation of how a car
works, for example, they would be able to see how an electric drive train works. Again, this
demonstration will be multithreaded, such that each component in the drive train (for
example) can communicate with the other components in it, like the electric motor can
send a message regarding it’s power use to the thread that runs the battery so that the
battery level can be updated.

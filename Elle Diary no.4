INDIVIDUAL DIARY

	We held a brief meeting after the one hour lecture for CSCI321 and Kapil, our team leader informed us that Koren would be unavailable for meetings this week. Hence, we sat and discussed what would be the plan for this entire week. Shien Wee suggested that we look up for other Typing Tutors that would be our possible competitor, and probably from there, we would be able to discover any functionality that our Typing Tutor might need. In addition, the group also agreed that a small test development should be carried out to link the Leap Motion to Unity using Unityâ€™s SDK. At least we could show something to Koren. 
	Thus, we came to a decision that the job would be divided amongst the four of us in groups of two, where one group (Kapil and Shien Wee) would be responsible for looking out for possible competitors and potential functionalities that might need to be added into our requirement list while the other group (Myself and Dyalan) will be in charge of the test development that will lead to our first prototype that we will hopefully be able to show Koren by the following week.
